    <p face="helvetica-light" class="less-space">This application allows Facebook users to visualize the relationships
        with their friends with whom they communicate via chat. The visual illustrates how communication between
        individuals changes over time with respect to formality of language and frequency of talk. The quantity of
        messages sent during a day is represented in bars, while the formality of language is shown as a gradient of
        color; the darker the color the more formal the language. For each conversation, an overall view, and a
        sent-and-received view are available to show the user a deeper element of the communication.
        <br>
        <br>

        We determined the formality ranking system by comparing chat data to proper grammar, capitalization,
        punctuation, and the occurrence of misspelled words.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through these visualizations we expected to see a decrease in formality over time. What we saw instead was while
        there was a general decrease in formality, there were spikes of more formal language at given, fairly constant
        intervals- usually during week days. In certain instances, there was a greater amount of talk per day at the
        beginning of the relationship, and it petered off as time went on. </p>
